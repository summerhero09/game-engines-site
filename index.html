      <h1>Post Mortem</h1>
      <div class="centered">
        <p>
          For our project, we incorporated core game engine concepts while
          providing a solid foundation for users to build their own levels. The
          engine features an intuitive interface, and each type of game object
          exhibits distinct behavior, allowing for the creation of many
          different types of levels. Additionally, all of our sprites were drawn
          and designed by Chris and we curated a tileset from public tilesets,
          which gives our engine a unique and cohesive look. Overall, we
          produced a polished engine that developers can use effectively without
          a steep learning curve.
        </p>
        <p>
          While our engine turned out well, several key areas that we would
          improve upon with additional time are code organization/modularity,
          level-creation tools, and the visual user interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the challenges we ran into during development was maintaining
          clean organization across the large amount of code needed to support
          the engine’s functionality. If we were to spend more time on our
          engine, we would focus on refactoring the code in our level editor
          class to make it more efficient. For instance, the collision logic for
          the tile map could be abstracted into that class, and the logic for
          spawning objects on tiles could be moved into individual object
          scripts or integrated directly into the tile-map class.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another area for improvement is the creation of more advanced
          level-design tools. For example, implementing more advanced enemy
          logic and enemy movement patterns would allow users to design more
          challenging levels. Expanding the physics system beyond simple
          collisions to support elements like projectile attacks would also
          enhance gameplay possibilities. Additionally, being able to support
          multiple 2D perspectives (top-down and side-scrolling) would allow for
          more level design possibilities. A more complex tile-map system, such
          as one with multiple layers or customizable tile attributes beyond
          just texture, would also be a future improvement to our current
          systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, having a more expansive user interface is a future goal.
          Ideally, the user would be able to view the entire scene hierarchy,
          including game objects, similar to Unity’s scene view. It is also a
          goal to have a visual representation of the resource manager so the
          user can see what textures/objects have been loaded from the JSON
          file. Displaying the individual components associated with each game
          object would further improve usability. Additionally, if layers were
          included in the tile map or in the scene, the corresponding UI would
          also need to be created to allow users to manage those layers.
